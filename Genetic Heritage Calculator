Traits
Alcohol Flush Reaction	
Little or no flushing
rs671:GG
Alcohol flush reaction is a condition in which an individual's face or body experiences flushes or blotches as a result of an accumulation of acetaldehyde, a byproduct of the catabolic metabolism of alcohol.

This reaction is usually experienced by people of East Asian descent - according to the analysis by HapMap project the allele of the ALDH2 gene responsible for this reaction is rare among Europeans and Africans, very rare among Mexican-Americans but quite common among people of Chinese and Japanese ancestry.

Bitter Taste Perception	
Can taste
rs713598:CG*
Not all humans have the same perception of bitterness - a genetic variation in TAS2R38 gene prevents some people from tasting propylthiouracil (PROP) - a compound often found in cabbage, raw broccoli, coffee and dark beers. About 25% of people lack ability to detect this compound due to gene mutations and they find most food and drink to be less bitter, or not bitter at all.

The ABO system is the most important blood-group system in human blood transfusion.

ABO types are classified by presense and absense of associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies. Presense of these antibodies is encoded by one genetic locus, the ABO locus, which has three alternative forms:A, B, and O. A child receives one of the three variants from each parent, giving rise to six possible genotypes and four possible blood types.

Breast size
Average cup size:C
Click to calculate
Breast size is moderately heritable and recent studies has identified a number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with breast size. These studies provide insight into the genetic factors underlying normal breast development and show that some of these factors are also shared with probability of having breast cancer.

Caffeine Consumption
Average: 280 mg/day

Caffeine acts as a central nervous system stimulant, temporarily warding off drowsiness and restoring alertness. Beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee, tea, soft drinks, and energy drinks, enjoy great popularity; 90% of adults consume caffeine daily. Ordinary consumption has low health risks, but consumption of large amounts of caffeine can lead to both positive and negative effects.

High-density lipoprotein (HDL, "Good Cholesterol") is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins that enable lipids like cholesterol and triglycerides to be transported within the water-based bloodstream. In healthy individuals, about thirty percent of blood cholesterol is carried by HDL.

HDL particles are able to remove cholesterol from within artery atheroma and transport it back to the liver for excretion or re-utilization. People with higher levels of HDL seem to have fewer problems with cardiovascular diseases, while those with low HDL cholesterol levels have increased rates for heart disease.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL, "Bad Cholesterol") is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins that enable lipids like cholesterol and triglycerides to be transported within the water-based bloodstream.

Studies have shown that higher levels of type LDL particles correlate with much faster growth of atheroma, progression of atherosclerosis and earlier and more severe cardiovascular disease events.

Cholesterol is an organic chemical substance classified as a waxy steroid of fat. Although cholesterol is important and necessary for human health, high levels of cholesterol in the blood have been linked to damage to arteries and cardiovascular disease.

The Cholesterol levels include:

LDL (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 'bad' cholesterol)
HDL (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 'good' cholesterol)
Triglycerides (fats carried in the blood)

Cleft lip and cleft palate are variations of a type of clefting congenital deformity caused by abnormal facial development. Approximately 1 in 700 children born have a cleft lip and/or a cleft palate.

Cleft lip is formed in the top of the lip as either a small gap or it continues into the nose. Cleft palate is a condition in which the two plates of the skull that form the hard palate are not completely joined.

Earwax type	
Click to calculate
Some people have earwax that is wet, sticky and yellow or brown; other people's earwax is dry, crumbly and grayish.

The type of earwax is determined by a variation at a single gene (ATP-binding cassette C11 gene), with the 'wet earwax' allele being dominant over the 'dry earwax' one.

The pigmentation of the iris in humans varies from light brown to black, depending on the concentration of melanin in the iris pigment epithelium (located on the back of the iris). In conjunction with white collagen fibers it produces different shades of grey, green and hazel.

Eye color is an inherited polygenic trait, influenced by more than one gene - there is evidence that as many as 16 different genes could be responsible for eye color in humans - yet studies show that it is possible to predict eye color with enough accuracy by using only 6 SNPs.

Hair color is determined by the amount of two pigments - brown-black eumelanin predominates in black and brown hair and red-yellow pheomelanin in red hair. Blond hair contains low levels of both pigments.

The genetics of human hair color are not firmly established yet, but there are indications that multiple genes determine whether a person will have brown, blond or red hair.

Lactose intolerance	
Likely tolerant
rs4988235:AG
Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and in some milk-derived dairy products.

Lactose intolerant individuals have insufficient levels of lactase, the enzyme that metabolizes lactose into glucose and galactose, in their digestive system. This condition is quite common in adults and is not dangerous, but has unpleasant symptomes such as abdominal bloating and cramps, flatulence, diarrhea or nausea after consuming significant amounts of dairy products.

Male Pattern Baldness is the most common cause of hair loss in men. In classic pattern baldness, hair is lost in a well-defined pattern, beginning above both temples. Hair also thins at the crown of the head. Often a rim of hair around the sides and rear of the head is left.

Heart rate is the number of heartbeats per unit of time, usually expressed as beats per minute (bpm). Heart rate can vary as the body's need to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide changes, such as during physical exercise or sleep. The typical resting heart rate in adults is 60 to 100 bpm. Resting Heart Rates below 60 bpm may be referred to as bradycardia, while rates above 100 bpm at rest may be called tachycardia.
